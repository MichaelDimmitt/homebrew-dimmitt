## Quick Start:
Fork this project and brew tap will work for you!
```bash
{
  brew tap <your-name-here>/taps &&
  brew install dir &&
  brew install reveal;
}
```
you might need to update the sha.
the url is where the magic happens.

## Ohhhhh, so you want to have your own tap of this brew?
https://docs.brew.sh/How-to-Create-and-Maintain-a-Tap
1) a compressed folder with an executable using your brew's name
2) the executable can be any script (bash, ruby, zsh, etc...).
3) copy the link generated by the release to the zipped folder.
4) no need to use a brew create just make a repo!
5) This repo is named homebrew-taps ... causing `brew tap michaeldimmitt/taps` to work!
```bash
mkdir homebrew-taps
cd homebrew-taps
```
6) make a ruby file with the name of your future formula look at [dir](https://github.com/MichaelDimmitt/homebrew-taps/blob/working-homebrew-tap-example/dir.rb) to see how it is done. ðŸ”¥
7) my formulae is super simple ... it just installs a script into bin/local making it executable!
```bash
# note: any brew formulae is able to be viewed after being downloaded.
# simply type:

brew edit <brew name>
```

## Steps to add the example brew to the current tap:
#### create a release including: 
1) a compressed folder with an executable using your brew's name
2) the executable can be any script (bash, ruby, zsh, etc...).
3) copy the link generated by the release to the zipped folder.
```
- url "https://github.com/MichaelDimmitt/dir/archive/0.1.1.tar.gz"
+ url "https://github.com/MichaelDimmitt/homebrew-taps/releases/download/1.0.0/example-1.0.0.zip"
```
4) create to a new file on github named example.rb 
5) paste the link the link to your release into "url"
6) make changes:
```diff 
- class Dir < Formula
- bin.install "dir"
                     
+ class Example < Formula
+ bin.install "example"
```
3) my formula is super simple ... it just installs a script into bin/local making it executable!
4) change the url in your formula 
5) `brew tap michaeldimmitt/taps && brew install example;`
6) you will get a sha mismatch! copy the actual sha and paste it into the sha section.
```
-  sha256 "254086751cfed11f3a067036562234a80ea7169d5ef6890fa14b96827992bfde"
+  sha256 "f79eb924a81c50522d6c1f5cd8b20bb3d10f83098a0381d495f50c45fc65ae3e"
```
7) `brew install example;`
8) `example`
